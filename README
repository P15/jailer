Database Subsetting Tool

Jailer is a tool for database subsetting, schema and data browsing. It exports consistent, 
referentially intact row-sets from relational databases. It removes obsolete data without 
violating integrity. It is DBMS agnostic (by using JDBC), platform independent, and generates 
DbUnit datasets, hierarchically structured XML, and topologically sorted SQL-DML.


Features

      and imports the data into your development and test environment.
    * Improves database performance by removing and archiving obsolete data without violating integrity.
    * Generates hierarchically structured XML, topologically sorted SQL-DML and DbUnit datasets.
    * Open Source. Entirely written in Java. Platform independent. DBMS agnostic.
